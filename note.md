## Why is binary important
- Computer parts are engineered to understand only two symbols: 0, 1.
- 0 means low voltage, and 1 means high voltage.
- Binary is base 2
- Every binary digit is called a bit.
- To convert binary to decimal, you need to be familiar with the power of 2.

## Decimal Representation
- We use this in our daily lives ex. (1 - 10).
- This is known as base 10 or decimal
- Decimal means 10
- The significance of every digit is related to its location in the number - this  is called "positional notation"
- Leading zeroes don't change the value of the number.
