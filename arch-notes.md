## x86 Processor Modes
- x86 processors have several modes, that help with backwards compatibility.
- `Real mode` is the operation mode of the 8086 processor, 
    - It has very limited memory access(acess to less than 1MB of code and data)
    - Every x86 processor starts in the real mode.
- `Protected Mode`(SInce intel's 80286 processor)  has access to larger amounts of memory(1 GB in 16 bit)
    - Provides memory protection
    - Helps the operating system manage a multitasking environment.

## Misc
- Embedded systems - are usuallly small computers that are meant to do one thing(like a router, computer in a car)
